# PvZ ZPG

Welcome to PvZ ZPG - The Zombie RPG
(Place-holder name)

## What Am I Doing ?
I plan to create a turn-based RPG game where you are the Zombies.
This project is a small thing that I want to work on on my free time

## General Plans

This game will, eventually, include themed regions based on the worlds of the PvZ franchise. 
These worlds will have randomly generated battles and bosses fitting for the themes.

## Disclaimer

I have no prior knowledge of coding and am doing this entirely as a learning project.

## Collaborations And Shout Outs

This game is done somewhat in collaboration with @AnJoMorto and I's PvZ Rogue Garden as we will be using the same art style and sharing some of the sprites.
You can consider this game part of the Rogue Garden universe.

Special shout out to him.
