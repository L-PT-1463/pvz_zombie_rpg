[[Area]]

This area takes elements from both Ancient Egypt and the Wild West from PvZ 2. By mixing these hot environments and the Torchwood-burned peas with the cold plants of Ancient Egypt and the icy winds of the Frostbite Caves, it creates a fire-ice combo that is nicely complemented by the peas.
